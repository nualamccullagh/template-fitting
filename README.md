# template-fitting

The position of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) peak in the 2-point correlation function of galaxies in the Universe is a powerful probe of dark energy. This feature is a standard ruler throughout cosmic time, which means it can be used to measure the expansion rate of the Universe, which is highly sensitive to the nature of dark energy.

Template fitting is the preferred method used to locate the position of the BAO peak in the 2-point correlation function in observational data. This python script applies the template fitting method (discussed in detail in Xu, et al. (2012) (http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0091) to mock data from multiple cubic simulation boxes. It computes the average BAO peak position and the error on that position between the mutliple mock catalogues.
